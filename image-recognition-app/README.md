# 🌟 Image Recognition App 🖼️

Welcome to the Image Recognition App, developed by Sunny Jayendra Patel! 🚀

This application allows users to upload images and perform image recognition using a pre-trained deep learning model. It utilizes a combination of React for the frontend and Flask for the backend, providing a seamless user experience and efficient server-side processing. 🖥️

## ✨ Features ✨

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images from their device to the application.
- **Image Recognition**: The uploaded images are processed using a pre-trained deep learning model to recognize objects in the images.
- **Prediction Display**: The application displays the top predictions along with their probabilities for each uploaded image.
- **Modern UI**: The user interface is designed to be clean, modern, and user-friendly, providing an enjoyable experience for users. 🎨

## 📱 Frontend (React) 🌈

The frontend of the Image Recognition App is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It utilizes components such as buttons, input fields, and containers to create a seamless and intuitive user experience. 🚀

## 🖥️ Backend (Flask) 💡

The backend of the Image Recognition App is built using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. It handles image uploads, processes the images using a pre-trained deep learning model, and returns the prediction results to the frontend. 💻

## 🧠 Deep Learning Model 🤖

The image recognition functionality of the application is powered by a pre-trained deep learning model. The model is trained on a large dataset of images and is capable of recognizing a wide range of objects with high accuracy. 🌟
